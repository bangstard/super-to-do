/Users/qayyumcheri/Dev/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/shared_preferences_android-2.0.14/android/lint-baseline.xml: Information: 7 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true. Unmatched issue types: CommitPrefEdits (7) [LintBaseline]
0 errors, 0 warnings
